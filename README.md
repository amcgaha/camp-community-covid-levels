# Camp Community COVID Levels: 
## Informing Summer Camp Decisions Based on Localized Community Spread

I work for a summer camp in North Carolina. Our most important project this year is developing a safe opening plan in the context of COVID-19. With many best practices available, we would like to know how restrictive our policies and prodecures need to be this summer. We hope to strike a smart balance between classic camp freedoms and a safe environment. We want our restriction level to be informed by the epidemiological conditions in our campers' communities when we are making plans this spring. We also want to be able to adjust our plans as those conditions change throughout the summer. 

Right now we lack a robust way to incorporate COVID-19 data into our decision-making. How will we determine our risk level in the planning phase, as well as during the summer as conditions continue to evolve?

We know that in the US there are differences in covid outbreaks across communities, making location-specific data an important analytical tool. This project aims to connect the geography of COVID-19 data, including cases by county and positivity rates by state, with a database of enrolled campers that includes their zipcodes. The goal is to generate an interactive dashboard to inform our planning process over time.

The dashboard has three views. First, we plot the number of cumulative cases in each county our campers come from, displayed both on a map and a block chart that represents how many campers each county is currently contributing to our enrollment. Second, we display a similar chart with two state-level indicators: percent of tests that come back positive and the daily increase in cases. These two indicators help paint a more well-rounded picture of each location. 

Finally, we generate a list of anonymized campers and the sessions they're enrolled in, sorted by their home county's cumulative number of cases and state positive test rate. When joined to our private database, we can use this list to make contacts with campers from high-risk areas before camp to discuss a safety plan. 

When the dashboard is considered as a whole, we can gain a sense of not only how much risk our camper population will bring this summer, but also where the risks are coming from.
