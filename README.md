# Covid Camp Community

The summer camp I work for needs to know how restrictive their covid prodecures need to be this summer. For example, will we require covid tests from all campers? Because of the significant differences in covid outbreaks across communities, this project aims to connect the geography of covid data with a database of enrolled campers. The goal is to produce a list of campers who will be coming from areas with high community spread, which counties are high risk, and the average community spread across all camper communities.
