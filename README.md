# Camp Community COVID Levels: 
## Informing Summer Camp Decisions Based on Localized Community Spread

I work for a summer camp in North Carolina. Our most important project this year is developing a safe opening plan in the context of COVID-19. With many best practices available, we would like to know how restrictive our policies and prodecures need to be this summer. 

We hope to strike a smart balance between classic camp freedoms and a safe environment. We want our restriction level to be informed by the epidemiological conditions in our campers' communities when we are making plans this spring. We also want to be able to adjust our plans as those conditions change throughout the summer. 

Right now we lack a robust way to incorporate COVID-19 data into our decision-making. How will we determine our risk level in the planning phase, as well as during the summer as conditions continue to evolve?

We know that in the US there are differences in covid outbreaks across communities, making location-specific data an important analytical tool. This project connects the geography of COVID-19 data, including cases by county and positivity rates by state, with a database of enrolled campers that includes their zipcodes. The goal is to generate an interactive dashboard to inform our planning process over time.

A preview of the dashboard is embeded below. To visit the interactive version, [click here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/CampCovidAssessCountyDashboard/CampRiskProfile?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)
