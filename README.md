# Covid Camp Community

I work for a summer camp, and we are planning to run camp in 2021 after a hiatus in 2020. With many best practices available, we would like to know how restrictive our covid prodecures need to be this summer. We hope to strike a smart balance between classic camp activities and safe procedures, and we know this will depend on the prevailing conditions in May. However, we lack a robust way to incorporate covid data into our plans. 

For example, will we require covid tests from all campers? Because of the significant differences in covid outbreaks across communities, this project aims to connect the geography of covid data with a database of enrolled campers. The goal is to produce a list of campers who will be coming from areas with high community spread, which counties are high risk, and the average community spread across all camper communities.
