# Camp Community COVID Levels: 
## Informing Summer Camp Decisions Based on Localized Community Spread

I work for a summer camp in North Carolina. Our most important project this year is developing a safe opening plan in the context of COVID-19. With many best practices available, we would like to know how restrictive our policies and prodecures need to be this summer. We hope to strike a smart balance between classic camp freedoms and a safe environment. We want our restriction level to be informed by the epidemiological conditions in our campers' communities when we are making plans this spring. We also want to be able to adjust our plans as those conditions change throughout the summer. 

Right now we lack a robust way to incorporate COVID-19 data into our decision-making. How will we determine our risk level in the planning phase, as well as during the summer as conditions continue to evolve?

We know that in the US there are differences in covid outbreaks across communities, making location-specific data an important analytical tool. This project aims to connect the geography of COVID-19 data, including cases by county and positivity rates by state, with a database of enrolled campers that includes their zipcodes. The goal is to generate a self-updating dashboard to inform our planning process over time. 

The dashboard will has components. First, we produce a series of maps showing the intensity of community spread in the counties where most of our campers come from. Second, we generate a list of campers who will be coming from areas with high community spread. Finally, we create an overview of our community risk by calculating summary statistics of the community spread across all camper communities.
