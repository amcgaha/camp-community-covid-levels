# Covid Camp Community

I work for a summer camp in North Carolina, and our most important project this year is developing a safe opening plan in the context of COVID-19. With many best practices available, we would like to know how restrictive our policies and prodecures need to be this summer. We hope to strike a smart balance between classic camp freedoms and a safe environment, and we know this will depend on the prevailing conditions in May. However, we lack a robust way to incorporate covid data into our decision-making. 

Because of the significant differences in covid outbreaks across communities, this project aims to connect the geography of COVID-19 data with a database of enrolled campers that includes their zipcodes. The goal is to produce a list of campers who will be coming from areas with high community spread, a map of high risk counties, and an aggregate indicator of our community risk by calculating the average community spread across all camper communities.
